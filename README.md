# Mark's Boomer Shooter

![Boomer Shooter cover image](./Assets/cover-image.png)

This is an open source prototype of a Godot FPS Game.

Play it in your browser or download it for Linux and Windows on [Itch.io](https://bearlikelion.com/boomer-shooter)

I developed this over a weekend to get a better understanding of state machines.\
I learned a lot from the [Godot-4-fpsarms](https://github.com/gdquest-demos/godot-4-FPS-arms) demo

## Controls:
* WASD - Movement
* R - Reload
* Space - Jump
* Shift - Sprint
* Ctrl - Crouch
* Sprint+Crouch - Slide

## Save File
I use a Godot resource to save data for the player.
You can load the saved data statically using:\
	`var player_save: PlayerSave = PlayerSave.load_player_data()`

Add any export variables you wish to store, and then save using:\
	`player_save.save_player_data(player_save)`
