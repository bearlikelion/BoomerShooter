# Mark's Boomer Shooter

![Boomer Shooter cover image](./Assets/cover-image.png)

This is an open source prototype of a Godot FPS Game.

Play it in your browser or download it for Linux and Windows on [Itch.io](https://bearlikelion.com/boomer-shooter)

I developed this over a weekend to get a better understanding of state machines.\
I learned a lot from the [Godot-4-fpsarms](https://github.com/gdquest-demos/godot-4-FPS-arms) demo
